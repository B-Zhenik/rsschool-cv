## My little story

I am an engineer, this is the most accurate description of me. I love logic and rationality. From an early age, I dreamed of becoming an engineer, but at that time I did not know how wide this profession was. I was a process engineer, then a design engineer, created furniture and mining equipment. But all this clung only for the first time. Now I'm 29 years old and I'm trying my hand at programming. It seems to me that this profession has absorbed all the best and allows you to live more freely. I want to experience it for myself, that's why I'm here.

I can add about myself, I am hardworking, responsible, I learn quickly and I like to learn new things.
